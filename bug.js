This bug occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Image` component with a remote image URL that returns a 404 error.  The component doesn't always handle this gracefully, sometimes crashing or failing to render correctly.  The error messages may be vague or unhelpful, making debugging difficult.  Additionally, the image may briefly display a placeholder before crashing, leading to confusion.
